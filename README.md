Amazon Sales Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project analyzes Amazon sales data to uncover insights into product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for optimizing sales strategies, improving inventory management, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
Objectives

Identify top-selling products and categories.
Analyze sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, seasonal).
Examine customer purchasing patterns and regional sales distribution.
Detect factors influencing high/low sales (e.g., pricing, discounts, ratings).
Provide recommendations for business strategies based on insights.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle/Amazon Sales Dataset] (hypothetical source; replace with actual source if available). It contains sales records from Amazon, including:

Columns:
Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
Product: Product name.
Category: Product category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).
Price: Product price.
Discount: Discount applied (if any).
Quantity: Number of units sold.
Order Date: Date of the order.
Customer ID: Unique customer identifier.
Region: Geographic region of the sale.
Rating: Customer rating for the product (1–5 stars).


Size: Approximately 100,000 records.
Format: CSV (amazon_sales_data.csv).
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values (e.g., imputed missing ratings with median).
Removed duplicate orders.
Standardized date formats and categorical variables.



Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python 3.8+
Libraries:
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
scikit-learn: Machine learning for predictive analysis (if applicable).
jupyter: Interactive notebooks for analysis.


Environment: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Version Control: Git/GitHub.

Analysis Process

Data Preprocessing:
Loaded dataset using pandas.
Cleaned data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Converted Order Date to datetime format for time-series analysis.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculated total sales, average order value, and product popularity.
Visualized sales by category, region, and time (bar charts, line plots, heatmaps).
Analyzed correlations between price, discount, and sales volume.
Identified seasonal trends (e.g., holiday spikes).


Advanced Analysis:
Segmented customers based on purchase frequency and value.
Performed regression analysis to predict sales based on price and ratings (if applicable).
Identified outliers (e.g., unusually high sales for specific products).


Insights and Recommendations:
Highlighted top-performing categories and underperforming products.
Suggested optimal discount strategies to boost sales.
Recommended inventory adjustments based on seasonal trends.



Key Findings

Electronics and Clothing are the top-selling categories, accounting for 60% of total sales.
Sales peak during November–December due to holiday promotions.
Products with 20–30% discounts show a 25% higher sales volume.
Regions with higher customer ratings (>4 stars) have 15% more repeat purchases.
Low-rated products (<3 stars) contribute to only 5% of sales, indicating quality issues.

Recommendations

Focus marketing efforts on Electronics and Clothing during holiday seasons.
Offer targeted discounts (20–30%) to maximize sales without eroding margins.
Improve quality control for low-rated products to reduce returns and boost customer satisfaction.
Expand inventory in high-demand regions based on regional sales data.
